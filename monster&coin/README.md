# Monster Game (Phaser.js)

This is a simple Monster Game built using the Phaser.js framework. The initial version of this game was based on the [Phaser game tutorial](https://www.lessmilk.com/phaser-game-tutorial/) by LessMilk. However, several improvements and customizations have been added to make the game more feature-rich and functional.

## Features

- **Phaser.js Framework**: Built with Phaser.js, a fast and free game development framework for the web.
- **Custom Assets**: New assets were added as the original tutorial was missing some of the resources.
- **Sound Effects**: Sound has been integrated for a more immersive experience.
- **Movement Boundaries**: A border was added to prevent the monster from moving off-screen.
- **JavaScript Live Server**: Instead of using a Python server as suggested in the tutorial, I opted for `live-server` in JavaScript for a simpler setup.

## Getting Started

To get the game running locally, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** installed on your system.
- **Live Server**: You can use `live-server` to serve the game files locally.

### Installing Live Server

If you donâ€™t have `live-server` installed, you can easily add it by running:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

# Cloning the Repository
